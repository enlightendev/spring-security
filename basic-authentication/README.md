## About

Spring Angular app demonstrating basic http security.

Front end app and server side are served from the same server process. Future versions are saved from separate
processes.

## Security

Notice there are no Config classes set up with security details. We get basic http security by simply
including the following in our pom.

    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-security</artifactId>
    </dependency>

This ensures every end point is secured by basic http security resulting in a user getting an authentication pop up
generated by the browser.

## Testing 

- CURL/HTTP - https://github.com/jakubroztocil/httpie

in order to see the output you must pass username and password.
http -a user:password http://localhost:8181/resource

to see the error try w/o user/passwd.


- Browser
users going to http://locahost:8080/* are prompted with the default login dialog popup


## Users

This application does not override the default user store created by
including <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-security</artifactId>. Thus we configure the only user using application.yml


## Angular

- served directly from public folder
